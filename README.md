## Getting Started



[TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/) (Formerly LambdaTest) is the world's first full-stack AI Agentic Quality Engineering platform that empowers teams to test intelligently, smarter, and ship faster. Built for scale, it offers a full-stack testing cloud with 10K+ real devices and 3,000+ browsers. With AI-native test management, MCP servers, and agent-based automation, TestMu AI supports Selenium, Appium, Playwright, and all major frameworks. 



With TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest), you can run automated Selenium and Playwright tests for the sample To-Do app across real browsers and operating systems.



- [Sign up on TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/register/) (Formerly LambdaTest).

- Follow the [TestMu AI Documentation](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/) for the full setup walkthrough.



### Prerequisites



1. A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).

2. A TestMu AI account — sign up here.

3. Your TestMu AI Username and Access Key from the Automation Dashboard.

4. For automated tests: Node.js (v16 or higher) or Python 3.7+ depending on the test runner used.



### Setup



Clone the repository:



```bash

git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/sample-todo-app

cd sample-todo-app

```



Open `index.html` directly in a browser to view the To-Do app, or serve it with a local HTTP server:



```bash

npx serve .

```



Set your TestMu AI credentials as environment variables:



- For Linux/macOS:



```bash

export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME"

export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"

```



- For Windows:



```bash

set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME"

set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"

```



### Run tests



Run Selenium tests against the TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest) grid:



```bash

cd selenium

npm install

npm test

```



Run Playwright tests:



```bash

cd playwright

npm install

npx playwright test

```



### Local testing with TestMu AI Tunnel



To test locally hosted apps, set up the TestMu AI tunnel. OS-specific guides:



- [Local Testing on Windows](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/local-testing-for-windows/)

- [Local Testing on macOS](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/local-testing-for-macos/)

- [Local Testing on Linux](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/local-testing-for-linux/)



Configure tunnel in your test capabilities:



```javascript

const capabilities = {

  tunnel: true

};

```

## LambdaTest is Now TestMu AI



On **January 12, 2026**, [LambdaTest evolved to TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/lambdatest-is-now-testmuai/), the world's first fully autonomous **Agentic AI Quality Engineering Platform**.



Same team. Same infrastructure. Same customer accounts. All existing LambdaTest logins, scripts, capabilities, and integrations continue to work without change.

### How LambdaTest Evolved into TestMu AI



In 2017, we launched LambdaTest with a simple mission: make testing fast, reliable, and accessible. As LambdaTest grew, we expanded into Test Intelligence, Visual Regression Testing, Accessibility Testing, API Testing, and Performance Testing, covering the full depth of the testing lifecycle.



As software development entered the AI era, testing had to evolve, too. We rebuilt the architecture to be AI-native from the ground up, with autonomous agents that **plan, author, execute, analyze, and optimize tests** while keeping humans in the loop. The platform integrates with your repos, CI, IDEs, and terminals, continuously learning from every code change and development signal.



That evolution earned a new name: **TestMu AI**, built for an AI-first future of quality engineering. TestMu is not a new name for us. It is the name of our annual community conference, which has brought together 100,000+ quality engineers to discuss how AI would reshape testing, long before that became an industry norm. 



What started as a high-performance cloud testing platform has transformed into an AI-native, multi-agent system powering a connected, end-to-end quality layer. That evolution defined a new identity: LambdaTest evolved into TestMu AI, built for an AI-first future of quality engineering.
